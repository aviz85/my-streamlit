## 🌟 What's This Magic?
Ever wondered what would happen if an AI tried to out-poet Shakespeare while keeping the vibe of a friendly coffee shop poet? Well, wonder no more! Welcome to AI Poetry Buddy, where Claude (our AI friend) tries really hard not to embarrass itself with literary attempts!

### 🔍 Poetry Analysis
Like having a literature professor in your pocket, minus the tweed jacket and existential questions!

Your personal cheerleader who never runs out of breath!
